## How to install and run

Download the zip file from https://github.com/sovietspaceship/elden-ring-tourney-manager-releases/releases/latest and extract anywhere.

To run, execute `run.win.bat` if you're on Windows (most users), or `run.mingw.sh` if you want to run under a MinGW-like environment. (`run.linux.sh` launches on Linux, but it's not fully supported yet).

A terminal window will appear and *must remain open*. Your browser will automatically open a new tab. If not, navigate to http://localhost:6560/manage to access the management view.

- http://localhost:6560/manage: Management view
- http://localhost:6560/scenes: List of scenes to add to OBS as browser sources
- http://localhost:6560/current-match: Current match (e.g. healthbars) for OBS
- http://localhost:6560/players: Player cards for OBS
